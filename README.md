# Neovim_Conf
Repo containing all my NeoVim Config files

Make sure to have NeoVim installed. 
You can install it using brew on MacOS or any other package manager.

Then clone this repository in .config folder if you are in Linux/Mac, Idk about Windows because Windows is for Gae People and then use the plugins-setup.lua file to install all the extensions.
You can add your own vim-colors as well, Thats all upto you. ;)
